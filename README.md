This tool allows the concentration of Prism Central API calls to a single point to simplify filtering and limit access.

This tool has been tested with the following components:

- CSI v3.0.0, v3.2.0
- CAPX v1.2.3, v1.5.3
- CCM v0.3.2, v0.5.0
- Openshift IPI 4.13
- NKP 2.14.0
- COSI 0.4.0

Tools and APIs call may evolve over time, which may require updating the proxy configuration before upgrading any dependent solutions.


## How to use this image

Start a `ntnx-api-proxy` instance via [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose) or [`docker stack deploy`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/)

Basic example `docker-compose.yml` for `ntnx-api-proxy`:

```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:

  ntnx-api-proxy:
    image: ghcr.io/nutanix-cloud-native/ntnx-api-proxy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 9440:9440
      # - 8080:8080 #used for metrics export
    environment:
      FQDN: proxy-pc.demo.com
      NUTANIX_ENDPOINT: pc.demo.com
      # TRAEFIK_LOG_LEVEL: "info"
      #TRAEFIK_LOG_FORMAT: "json"
      #TRAEFIK_ACCESSLOG_FORMAT: "json"
      # TRAEFIK_SERVERSTRANSPORT_ROOTCAS: /etc/traefik/cert/ca.cer
      # DASHBOARD: enable
      # TRAEFIK_METRICS_PROMETHEUS: true
      # NOFILTER: true
    volumes:
      - ./cert:/etc/traefik/cert
```

Valid certificate files are required in the file locations below:

`/etc/traefik/cert/tls.crt`: Certificate used by the proxy to expose the service

`/etc/traefik/cert/tls.key`:  Key related to the proxy certificate



## Configuring the proxy

Proxy configuration is configured using the following env variables:

| Name | Description                                              | Mandatory | Default |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| FQDN | Fully Qualified Domain Name used to expose proxy service | true      | *none*  |




Backend connection is configured using the following env variables:

| Name             | Description                                                  | Mandatory | Default |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| NUTANIX_ENDPOINT | Fully Qualified Domain Name used to connect to Prism Central | true      | *none*  |
| NUTANIX_PORT     | Port to connect to Prism Central                             | false     | 9440    |



Advanced configuration is possible using the following env variables:

| Name                                        | Description                             | Mandatory | Default |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| DASHBOARD                                   | Set dashboard (enable/disable)          | false     | disable |
| TRAEFIK_LOG_LEVEL                           | Log level of proxy logs                 | false     | error   |
| TRAEFIK_SERVERSTRANSPORT_ROOTCAS            | Path of the CA file to validate backend | false     | *none*  |
| TRAEFIK_SERVERSTRANSPORT_INSECURESKIPVERIFY | Disable SSL certificate verification    | false     | false   |
| TRAEFIK_METRICS_PROMETHEUS                  | enable metrics export via Prometheus    | false     | false   |
| NOFILTER                                    | disable filter mode                     | false     | false   |


## Advanced configuration



#### Internal/self-signed CA

If you want to validate your backend server against an internal CA you need to set the env `TRAEFIK_SERVERSTRANSPORT_ROOTCAS` with your CA file path and present the corresponding file in your container.

ex: `TRAEFIK_SERVERSTRANSPORT_ROOTCAS=/etc/traefik/cert/ca.crt`



#### Proxy Dashboard

You can enable the proxy dashboard by setting `DASHBOARD` to `enable`.

Proxy will be available at the following address: `https://FQDN:9440/dashboard/`
